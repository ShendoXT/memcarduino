custom serial port speeds
crc the card, the whole card, and nothing but the card
instead of ignoring a bad read, add 128 bytes of null (or x00 if better)
a coffee brewing function
support for writing to memory card (most likely only a full card write, while frames are supported, its easier to just do a full mcr)
make big realisation that .bin==.mcr and that both are the same
add support to erase a card (easily just set ifile=/dev/null) //if its not obvious DONT DO THIS!!!!!
make todo funnier
better comments
better readme
better python script
support for cards that are larger then a official ps1 (tecknically already possible, just not from command line)
should run verification that a MemCARDuino is connected,and then a verify that a memcard is connected (again support is on the memcarduino, but my 1337 coding sckillz arnt aw3s0m enough)
remove all crappy 1337 speak from todo
